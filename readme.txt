This is my "curiosity project". I borrowed Tetris code from someone on youtube and unfortunately forgot to save his name. So I apogolize for not giving you credit for the code and thank you.

Anyway this project is simply about making a Neural Network which is learning how to play tetris. "Learning" is maybe not the best word since I am using genetic algo for weights optimization. I did it this way because I have almost no practical knowledge about building a Neural Networks so optimizing weights with help of genetic algo is the only solution that came to my mind. I am also familiar with back propagation but absolutely don't know how would I use it for this case.

Feel free to read/edit/use/share this code.
